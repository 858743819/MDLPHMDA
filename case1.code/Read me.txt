MDLP: the main function to predict potential microbes for all diseases based on known microbe-disease associations.
Lrr: creat new adjacency matrix of microbe-disease associations based on SLM.
similarity_disease:the calculation of integrated disease similarity.
similarity_microbe: the calculation of Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes.
The scores of all the candidate microbe-disease pairs would be obtained in the all.xlsx.
the scores of cididate miRNAs for each investigated diseases predicted by MDLPHMDA would be obtained in the file of result.
